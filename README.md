Simple recipes website

I will create a index page with a list of dishes, all dishes listed will have links to actual recipe.

This way when I click my favorite dish I will have the recipe to cook it myself.

I expect to use my html learning skills until this moment to do this page, and will include listing <ul> or <ol> with <li> in both. As well <a> one page to other and maybe put some <img> on the website.
